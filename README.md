# Image Search Engine

**UniTn Machine Learning project 2022**

The main objective of this project is to create an image search engine where a query image is fed to a model that will return the most N similar images from a gallery. The following example shows the problem of retrieving the same place based on a visual search algorithm.

&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Given the input query image, the algorithm has to be capable of matching the input query image with another gallery image depicting the same animal.

&nbsp;&nbsp; b. The expected algorithmâ€™s output is therefore a list of ranked matches between the query image and the gallery images. An example output is depicted below where the top-k matches are reported. In this case, the algorithm correctly matched top-1 and top-2 images while the others (the ones reported) are false matches.
